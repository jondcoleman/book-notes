## Schedules have 3 purposes

>...to make commitments about when things will be done.
>...to encourage everyone to see her efforts as part of a whole, and to invest in making her pieces work with the others.
>...to provide a tool to track progress and break work into manageable chunks.

<!---->

>This psychological shift is called a forcing function. A *forcing function* is anything that - when put in place - naturally forces a change in perspective, attitude and behavior. So, schedules are important forcing functions for projects. If used properly by a MP, schedules force everyone to carefully think through the work they need to do. This forcing function is a critical step toward realizing the project's potential. Even if the schedule slips, is doubled, or is halved, the commitments and connections everyone has made as a result of drafting the schedule can be maintained. So, this second purpose of a schedule can be achieved and can be entirely worthwhile even if the schedule itself turns out to be seriously inaccurate.

>...a good schedule gives a clearer view of the project, flushes out challenges and oversights early, and increases the odds that good things will happen.

>Often, obsessing over the process is a warning sign of leadership trouble: it can be an attempt to offload the natural challenges and responsibilities managers face in bureaucratic procedures that cloud the need for real leadership action.

## What schedules look like

A basic rule for all schedules: the rule of thirds (it's general and rough but helpful):
>Break the time available into three parts - one for design, one for implementation, and one for testing.

## Why schedules fail

>Project schedules are the easy scapegoats for everything that can possible go wrong. If someone fudges an estimate, misses a requirement, or gets hit by a bus, it's the schedule (and the person responsible for it) that catches the blame. If the nation's power supply were to go out for 10 days, or the team's best programmers were to catch the plague, invariably someone would say, "See, I told you the schedule would slip" and wag her finger in the schedule master's face. It's completely unfair, but it happens all the time. As much as people loath schedules, they still hold them up to an achievable standard. Even the best schedulers in the world, with the smartest minds an the best tools at their disposal, are still attempting to predict the future - something our species rarely does well.

>But if a team starts a project fully aware of the likely reasons schedules fall apart and takes some action to minimize those risks, the schedule can become a more useful and accurate tool in the development process.

<!---->

>Often, people fall victim to the precision versus accuracy trap: an impressive looking schedule with specific dates and times (precision) isn't necessary close to reflecting reality (accuracy). **Precision is easy, but accuracy is very difficult.** [Emphasis mine]

<!---->

>There is strong evidence that it is difficult for anyone to estimate the amount of time required early on in a project.

>Barry Boehm, in his 1988 essay on software engineering found that schedule errors scale in relation to how early in the project schedule estimation is done.

### A schedule is a probability

>So, if everyone on the team can agree that the schedule is a set of probabilities, the problem isn't the schedule itself - it's in how the schedule is used. **If ever a schedule is shown in a team meeting, or sent around in an email, a valid question is this: how probably is the defined timeline? If no probability is offered (e.g., what the five most likely risks are and a speculation on the probability of their occurrence), and whoever made a schedule can't offer explanations as to the assumptions she is making, it should always be assumed that the schedule is possible but improbable.** It should be open to the team to make suggestions as to what considerations or information can be added or changed in the schedule to make it more probable. [Emphasis mine]

>The secret here is that a schedule doesn't have to be perfect (which is a relief, of course, because there are no perfect schedules). Schedules need to be good enough for the team and the leaders to believe in, provide a basis for tracking and making adjustments, and have a probability of success that satisfies the client, the business, or the overall project sponsor.

### Estimating is difficult

>...even programmers who understand the estimation process and believe in it, don't like to do it. Part of it is the mismatch of imagination ("How will this work, given the very limited information I have?") with the temporal precision ("Tell me exactly how many hours this will take to do.").

Speaking on the similarity and difference in estimation in other fields:

>The primary difference is in how much time they are given to generate estimates and how disciplined they are in the use of that time.

<!---->

### Good estimates come from good designs

>Good engineering estimates are possible only if you have two things: good information and good engineers.

<!---->

>If leaders acknowledge weak estimates in the schedule and are comfortable with greater schedule risk, there's nothing wrong with weak estimates. On smaller, faster projects, rough estimates may be all that the project needs. Requirements may change often, and the nature of the business might demand more flexibility. There's nothing wrong with low quality estimates, provided no one is confusing them with high-quality ones.

<!---->

>A handy technique I found was that whenever a programmer balked at giving an estimate, I'd ask, "What questions can I answer that would make you more confident about giving an estimate?"

<!---->

Some ways to ensure good estimates:

* Establish baseline confidence intervals for estimates

>If you decide to ask your team to improve the quality of estimates, you must match this request with more time for them to do so.

* Lead programmers must set the bar for quality estimations by asking good questions and taking wise approaches that the team can emulate.
* Programmers should be trusted.
* Estimates depend on the programmer's understanding of project goals.
* Estimates should be based on previous performance.
* Specification or design quality should be to whatever point engineering needs to make good estimates.
* There are know techniques for making better estimates. (e.g. PERT)

## What must happen for schedules to work

* Milestone length should match project volatility.
* Be optimistic in the vision and skeptical in the schedule.

>A major psychological challenge for schedule is to make use of proper skepticism, without deflating the passion and motivation of the team.
>The numbers that are written down to estimate how long things should take require a brutal and honest respect for Murphy's Law... Schedules should not reflect what might happen under optimal conditions.

* Bet on design.
* Plan checkpoints for add/cut discussions.
* Inform the team about planning philosophy.
* Gauge the team's experience with the problem space.
* Gauge the team's confidence and experience in working together.
* Take on risks early.
