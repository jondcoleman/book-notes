>"failures force us to pay attention.  They demand us to re-examine assumptions we'd forgotten were there..." is beneficial to look at project management throughout history as well as project management in other fields.

>"...project management as an art: it requires intuition, judgment and experience..."

On leadership & management:

>No matter how much you try to separate them, managing well requires leadership skills, and leading well requires management skills.

<!-- -->

>In reality, there are always just three things: a goal, a pile of work, and a bunch of people.  

<!-- -->

>Confusing processes with the goals is on of the greatest sins of management.  

<!-- -->

>So, instead of focusing on processes and methods, project managers should be focused on their teams.  Simple planning or tracking systems should certainly be used, but they must match the complexity of the project and the culture of the team.  More precisely, planning and tracking should support the team in reaching project goals--not inhibit them.

>Manager are not hired to contribute a linear amount of work like a worker or programmer is expected to do.  Instead, leaders and managers are hired to amplify the value of everyone around them. The methods for adding this kind of value are different from working on the line.  But because many manager are former programmers and were promoted into management from the line, odds are good that they have more confidence and skills at writing code than they do leading and managing people who are writing code.

>Like a coach for a baseball team, the presence of a manager is supposed to contribute something different in nature from adding another individual contributor.  Sometimes this is done by settling arguments or shielding the team from politics.  Other times, it's providing good, high-level plans for finding clever workarounds for unexpected situations. Because these contributions are harder to measure, many PMs struggle with the ambiguity of their role.  As managers, they are easy targets for blame and have few places to hide. It takes a combination of conviction, confidence, and awareness to be effective and happy as a leader of a team.

>It's all of the small bits of information transfer...that make mediocre teams good and good teams great.  

<!-- -->

>There is one simple incontrovertible fact: project managers or leaders spend more time with each person on the team than anyone else. They are in more meetings, drop by more offices, and talk to more individual contributors than any other person. They may make or influence more decisions than anyone else in the organization  If the project manager is happy, sad motivated, or depressed, some of that is going to rub off on everyone she encounters. What PMs bring to the project, good or bad, will be contagious for the rest of the team.  

<!-- -->

>[The project manager] just needs to be genuinely interested in helping his teammates' reports and be successful at it more often than not.  

<!-- -->

>Project management is about using any means necessary to increase the probability and speed of positive outcomes.

>A useful daily mantra I've used is "*Make good stuff happen.*" (emphasis mine)

Author's summary:

- Project management is everywhere, and it's been around for a long time.
- If you keep a beginner's mind, you'll have more opportunities to learn.
- Project management can be a job, a role, or an activity.
- Program management is Microsoft's strongly defined project management role. It is derived from the idea of a matrix organization.
- Leadership and management require an understanding of, and intuition for, several common paradoxes. These include ego/no-ego, autocracy/delegation, and courage/fear.
- Watch out for pretension and over-involvement in your management activity. The process should support the team, not the other way around.
- If you are a dedicated manager, look for ways to capitalize on your unique perspective of the team and project.
